# Installing .Net Core on Ubuntu

Currently exercism.io does'nt provide guidance on the installation of .Net, to be able to build in C#.

To reduce the chances of having some incompatibility between the proposed exercises and the Mono .net implementation, I've chosed to use .Net Core.

The installation instrutions for Ubuntu 16.04 (which is the release I currently use) are [here](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linux/ubuntu16-04)
